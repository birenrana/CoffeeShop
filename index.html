<h1>All About Cofffee</h1>
<aside>
<blockquote>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from<a href="roasting.html"> roasted </a> coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
 When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried.
 Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.
 Most inexpensive (under $30 or so)<a href="grinding.html"> grinders </a> use a sharp metal blade to literally chop up your coffee beans.
 Roasted beans are ground and then<a href="brewing.html"> brewed </a> with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.</blockquote>

 <p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
 It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways
 (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
 Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts.
 A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).</p>
 
 <p>Where Do Coffee Beans Come From?<br/>
Ethiopia is the origin of both arabica and robusta beans, but they each now grow in a variety of different countries across the world map, 
especially in Latin America, Central America, Africa and parts of Asia. Arabica beans are primarily grown in Brazil 
but can also be found in countries like Colombia, Honduras and Mexico.
 Robusta also grows in Brazil but is even more common in Vietnam; other robusta coffee growing regions include Indonesia, 
 India, and Uganda.</p>
