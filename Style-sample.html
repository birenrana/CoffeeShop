	and dried. Dried coffee seeds are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.

	Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the world, is the best known ingredient of coffee.
	Its beneficial effects on the human body has been researched quite well, 
	but coffee as a whole is a complex beverage with a thousand different substances. 
	Some studies argue that decaf and caffeinated coffee may have the same health effects and suggest that it’s not the caffeine
	that is responsible for most of coffee's health benefits.
