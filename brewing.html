  <h1>Making Coffee</h1>
  
 <h2 id="bolling"><p>Brewing,<br/></h2>
  
  Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this,
  including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, 
  such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. 
  Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. 
  The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.</p>
  
  <p>Brewing with a paper filter produces clear, light-bodied coffee. While free of sediments, such coffee is lacking in some of coffee's oils and essences;
  they have been trapped in the paper filter.[4] Metal filters do not remove these components.
  It may be observed, especially when using a tall, narrow carafe, that the coffee at the bottom of the coffeepot is stronger than that at the top.
  This is because less flavor is available for extraction from the coffee grounds as the brewing process progresses.
  A mathematical argument has been made that delivering comparable strength in two cups of coffee is nearly achieved using a Thue-Morse sequence of pours.
  This analysis prompted a whimsical article in the popular press.</p>
